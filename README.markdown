### What?
wireless-prio is a small project designed to view, (re-order), and delete all the wireless networks (profiles) that you once connected to

### Why?
Microsoft has decided to delete this functionality ('Manage wireless networks') from Windows 8 and above.

### How?
Microsoft tells us that the 'new' way is through the commandline. I've used Native Wifi, which has been available since Windows XP2 (I only support Vista and above).
