### Status
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/lms9r1g8s50abxom)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/CSharpFan/wireless-prio)

### What?
wireless-prio is a small project designed to view, (re-order), and delete all the wireless networks (profiles) that you once connected to

### Why?
Microsoft has decided to delete this functionality ('Manage wireless networks') from Windows 8 and above. 

### How?
Microsoft tells us that the 'new' way is through the [commandline](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/manage-wireless-network-profiles).
I've used [Native Wifi](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms706556.aspx), which has been available since Windows XP2 (I only support Vista and above).
